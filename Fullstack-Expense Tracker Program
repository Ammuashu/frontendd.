class Expense:
    def __init__(self, category, amount, date):
        self.category = category
        self.amount = amount
        self.date = date

class ExpenseTracker:
    def __init__(self):

        new_expense = Expense(category, amount, date)
        self.expenses.append(new_expense)
        print("Expense added successfully!")

    def view_expenses(self):
        if self.expenses:
            for expense in self.expenses:
                print(f"Category: {expense.category}, Amount: {expense.amount}, Date: {expense.date}")
